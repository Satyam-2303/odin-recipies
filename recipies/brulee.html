    <h2>Creme Brulee</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Crème brûlée, also known as burnt cream, Cambridge burnt cream, 
        or Trinity cream,and virtually identical to crema catalana, is a dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large egg yolks </li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the lowest position.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg yolks, 1/4 white sugar, and vanilla together in a heatproof bowl until smooth. Bring cream just to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; 
            gradually whisk hot cream into egg yolk mixture (a little at a time to prevent the mixture from scrambling), whisking continuously until combined.</li>
        <li>For second marination, take a mixing bowl and add hung curd, your spices, salt to taste, ginger garlic paste and roasted besan, mix well(make sure you’ve already added salt in the first marination so add the salt accordingly.) 
            Add mustard oil and mix well, finally add the pre marinated chicken</li>
        <li> Bring a couple of inches of water to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; set the bowl with cream mixture over the saucepan to form a double boiler. 
            Cook, gently stirring with a wooden spoon, until cream mixture thickens enough to easily coat the back of the spoon.</li>
        <li> Pour hot cream into a heat-proof baking dish or individual ramekins set on a rimmed baking sheet. 
            Place in the preheated oven; bake until mixture sets but has a slight jiggle, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>To make the brown topping heat sugar in a pan until golden amber colored and then pour over your brulee and let it set</li>
    </ol>
